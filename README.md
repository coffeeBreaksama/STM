This is a GUI for sth industrial robots, My first projec that have given me a very large improve.
Cuz those code ,I realize read books(such as 《sicp》) is not the best way for me.I just write !Not read!
Oh, my English is not fine ,I hope you can understand what I mean.

When the first version was done,I find my code was like a shit.
But throgh re-build of three time, it is not so poor, and depandable most of the time.

The next project is using Linux and php to build a website.GOODLUCK coffee.
